You've just discovered a square (NxN) field and you notice a warning sign. The sign states that there's a single bomb in the 2D grid-like field in front of you.

Write a function mineLocation/MineLocation that accepts a 2D array, and returns the location of the mine. The mine is represented as the integer 1 in the 2D array. Areas in the 2D array that are not the mine will be represented as 0s.

The location returned should be an array (Tuple<int, int> in C#) where the first element is the row index, and the second element is the column index of the bomb location (both should be 0 based). All 2D arrays passed into your function will be square (NxN), and there will only be one mine in the array.

Examples:
mineLocation( [ [1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0] ] ) => returns [0, 0]
mineLocation( [ [0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0] ] ) => returns [1, 1]
mineLocation( [ [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0] ] ) => returns [2, 1]
*/

function mineLocation(field) {
  //TODO
  for (let i = 0; i < field.length; i++) {
    let currentArr = field[i];
    let indexOfMine = currentArr.indexOf(1);
    if (indexOfMine >= 0) return [i, indexOfMine];
  }
}
