<h2><a href=https://www.codewars.com/kata/56fb3cde26cc99c2fd000009/train/javascript target="_blank">ROT13 variant cipher</a></h2><h3>6 kyu</h3><p>You have been recruited by an unknown organization for your cipher encrypting/decrypting skills.<br>Being new to the organization they decide to test your skills.<br>Your first test is to write an algorithm that encrypts the given string in the following steps.</p><ol><li><p>The first step of the encryption is a standard ROT13 cipher.This is a special case of the caesar cipher where the letter is encrypted with its key that is thirteen letters down the alphabet,<br>i.e. <code>A =&gt; N, B =&gt; O, C =&gt; P, etc..</code></p></li><li><p>Part two of the encryption is to take the ROT13 output and replace each letter with its exact opposite. <code>A =&gt; Z, B =&gt; Y, C =&gt; X</code>.<br>The return value of this should be the encrypted message.</p></li></ol><p>Do not worry about capitalization or punctuation. All encrypted messages should be lower case and punctuation free.<br>As an example, the string <code>"welcome to our organization"</code> should return <code>"qibkyai ty ysv yvgmzenmteyz"</code>.</p><p>Good luck, and congratulations on the new position.</p>
