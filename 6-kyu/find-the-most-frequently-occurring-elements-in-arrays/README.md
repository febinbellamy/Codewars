Each of the 5 arrays includes 8 numbers which represent 3-hourly temperature forecast for a given day.</p><p><b>Output:</b> An array which includes the most frequent number (temperature) from each of the 5 arrays (days). In case there is a tie, return the value present later in a given array (day).</p><p>Example input:</p><p>var forecast_01 = {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "temperature": [<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    [15,17,19,21,21,21,20,16],<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    [16,17,22,22,22,22,20,16],<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    [12,17,19,20,20,20,20,18],<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    [14,15,19,19,20,22,18,17],<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    [15,17,24,24,24,20,20,20]<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;  ]<br>};</p><p>Example output:</p><p><code>getMostFrequent(forecast_01)  // should return [21,22,20,19,20]</code></p><p>Explanation of the example above:</p><p>The output is <code>[21,22,20,19,20]</code> because given 5 arrays, <br> <code>[15,17,19,21,21,21,20,16]</code> 21 is the most frequent in 1st array<br><code>[16,17,22,22,22,22,20,16]</code> 22 is the most frequent in 2nd array<br><code>[12,17,19,20,20,20,20,18]</code> 20 is the most frequent in 3rd array<br><code>[14,15,19,19,20,22,18,17]</code> 19 is the most frequent in 4th array<br><code>[15,17,24,24,24,20,20,20]</code> 24 and 20 appear 3 times each in 5th array so 20 is included in the output as the last 20 appears later than the last 24.</p>
