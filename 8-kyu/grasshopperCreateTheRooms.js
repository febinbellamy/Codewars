You are creating an "Escape the room" game. The first step is to create a hash table ( dict in Python) called rooms that contains all of the rooms of the game. There should be at least 3 rooms inside it, each room being a hash table with at least 3 properties (e.g. name, description, completed).
*/

// Add rooms here
var rooms = {
  room1: {
    name: "Jupiter",
    description: "Lorem Ipsum",
    completed: true,
  },
  room2: {
    name: "Saturn",
    description: "Lorem Ipsum",
    completed: true,
  },
  room3: {
    name: "Venus",
    description: "Lorem Ipsum",
    completed: false,
  },
};
