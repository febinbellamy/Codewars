The petals start to fall in late April.</p><p>Suppose that the falling speed of a petal is 5 centimeters per second (5 cm/s), and it takes 80 seconds for the petal to reach the ground from a certain branch.</p><p>Write a function that receives the speed (in cm/s) of a petal as input, and returns the time it takes for that petal to reach the ground <strong>from the same branch</strong>.</p><p>Notes:</p><ul><li>The movement of the petal is quite complicated, so in this case we can see the velocity as a constant during its falling.</li><li>Pay attention to the data types.</li><li>If the initial velocity is non-positive, the return value should be <code>0</code></li></ul>
