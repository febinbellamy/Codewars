You have been employed by MatchMyHusband to write a function that determines who matches!!</p><p>The rules are... a match occurs providing the husband's "usefulness" rating is greater than or equal to the woman's "needs".</p><p>The husband's "usefulness" is the <strong>SUM</strong> of his cooking, cleaning and childcare abilities and takes the form of an<strong> array </strong>.</p><p>usefulness example --&gt; [15, 26, 19] &nbsp;  (15 + 26 + 19) = 60</p><p>Every woman that signs up, begins with a "needs" rating of <strong>100</strong>. However, it's realised that the longer women wait for their husbands, the more dissatisfied they become with our service. They also become less picky, therefore their needs are subject to exponential decay of 15% per month. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_decay" data-turbolinks="false" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_decay</a></p><p>Given the number of months since sign up, write a function that returns "Match!" if the husband is useful enough, or "No match!" if he's not.</p>
