I want to input the type of bread and in return I want to know how long to toast the bread for.  </p><p>"white bread"             ---&gt;     "1 min" <br>"frozen white bread"      ---&gt;     "1.5 mins" <br>"brown bread"             ---&gt;     "2 mins" <br>"frozen brown bread"      ---&gt;     "3 mins" <br></p><p>Anything else that you put in the toaster should return "Please do not put that in the toaster!"</p><p>Your toaster has to be case insensitive. </p><p>This all seems easy enough! The only problem is that our toaster is unbelievably basic. You have to complete this function in just 250 characters!</p><p>If you use ES6 features like Let and Const declaration, the code will get longer due to the transformation by babel. </p>
