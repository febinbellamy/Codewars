Because they're good dogs. Over the weekend Bront has come in and hacked our system, lowering the ratings of dogs to below 10/10. Please help to fix Brant's bad system and give the dogs their original ratings. <em>They're good dogs Brent.</em></p><p>Task:<br>The <code>function weRateDogs(str, rating)</code> takes a string and an integer as the inputs. Within the string is an incorrect rating x/y. </p><p>You will need to change the incorrect rating <code>x/y</code> to the correct rating <code>rating/10</code>. The given string may contain numbers and letters, but no special characters other than <code>/</code>. </p><p>For example:<br>if you are given the following string:<br><code>'This is Max99. She has one ear that is always s1ightly higher than the other 4/10 wonky af'</code><br>And the following rating: <code>11</code>return: <code>'This is Max99. She has one ear that is always s1ightly heigher than the other 11/10 wonky af'</code></p>
