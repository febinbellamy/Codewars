The climate is amenable. The beer is fresh. And cold.</p><p>Two clans go to war.</p><p>Sat on opposite sides of a viking long table, the Bavarian Beer Bears and the Scandinavian Sch√∂llers prepare to go head-to-head in an historic challenge.</p><p>A Viking Game of Fives!</p><p>Vikings are friendly, beer guzzling folk. The aim of the game is for both teams to produce the same number of 5s so that the whole viking horde will recieve a free round of beer from the referee, Bjorg Bjorgeson.</p><p>However, Bjorg has been drinking all day and so has lost his ability to compare the number of fives that the Vikings are showing. </p><p>Create a function that takes in the two teams' arrays, compares the number of 5s shown and if they match, return "Drinks All Round! Free Beers on Bjorg!". </p><p>If they don't, return "Uh Oh! Bjorg's a donut! No beer for anyone!" .</p><p>It is guaranteed that both arrays will only contain integers <code>0</code> to <code>9</code>.</p>
