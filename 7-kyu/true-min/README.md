<h2><a href=https://www.codewars.com/kata/52378b3ee72f21e1ea000045/train/javascript target="_blank">True Min</a></h2><h3>7 kyu</h3><p>The Math.min function has stopped working, so we have to use our own function.  We are off to a good start, but this function doesn't seem to handle everything properly. Add in the proper checks to return <code>NaN</code> for anything that isn't an actual number, except treat <code>null</code> like <code>0</code>.</p><p>Note: This min function need not handle more than two arguments.</p><pre><code>function min(a, b){  return (a&lt;b)?a:b;}</code></pre>
