Unfortunately, they aren't formatted very well. They're all on one line, like this:</p><pre><code>Beautiful is better than ugly. Explicit is better than implicit. Simple is better than complex. Complex is better than complicated.</code></pre><p>What you want is to present each sentence on a new line, so that it looks like this:</p><pre><code>Beautiful is better than ugly.Explicit is better than implicit.Simple is better than complex.Complex is better than complicated.</code></pre><p>Write a function that takes a string (like the one line example) as an argument, returns a new string that is formatted across multiple lines, with each new sentence starting on a new line when you print it out.</p><p>Try to solve this challenge with the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.split" data-turbolinks="false" target="_blank">str.split()</a> and the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.join" data-turbolinks="false" target="_blank">str.join()</a> string methods.</p><p>Every sentence will end with a period, and every new sentence will have one space before the previous period. Be careful about trailing whitespace in your solution.</p>
