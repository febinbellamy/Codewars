Any other letters are considered invalid for Nucleotides of an RNA sequence.</p><p>Create a function to check the given sequence of letters to ensure there are no invalid Nucleotides.</p><p>Return the message "Valid Sequence: (letters sequence)" if that is true. </p><p>Return the message "There is an invalid letter: (letter). At position: (position in sequence)" for the first occurance of an invalid letter.</p><p>For example:</p><p>Given the sequence "AUAUA, the result should return "Valid Sequence: AUAUA".</p><p>Given the sequence "GAUAB", the result should return "There is an invalid letter: B. At position: 5".</p><ul> <li>The reported position of the first invalid letter should be using real world counting, counting from 1 not 0, e.g. from sequence AADF, D = position 3.</li><li>All inputs will be in uppercase and only letters A-Z.</li></ul><p>Good luck!</p>
