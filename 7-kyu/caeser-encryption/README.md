Caeser is impressed with your programming skills and has appointed you to be the new information security officer.</p><p>Caeser has ordered you to write a Caeser cipher to prevent Asterix and Obelix from reading his emails.</p><p>A Caeser cipher shifts the letters in a message by the value dictated by the encryption key. Since Caeser's emails are very important, he wants all encryptions to have upper-case output, for example:</p><p>If key = 3"hello" -&gt; KHOORIf key = 7"hello" -&gt; OLSSV</p><p>Input will consist of the message to be encrypted and the encryption key.</p>
