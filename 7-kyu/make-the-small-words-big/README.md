If only they had a code warrior to help them out...</p><p>Your task is to make all words which are 3 characters or less into capitals. You should also remove any vowels from 'long' (4 characters or more) words. </p><p>For example: </p><p><code>"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"</code></p><p>Should become:</p><p><code>"THE qck brwn FOX jmps vr THE lzy DOG"</code></p><p>For the purposes of this kata, mid-word punctuation counts towards the character limit of a word.</p><p>e.g: <code>"it's / I'm"</code> should become: <code>"t's / I'M"</code></p>
