He was too drunk to be aggressive towards me. He was letting everything what he held out, from both his mind and his stomach. Although i was a bit uncomfortable, the old man's broken wisdom words caught my attention.</p><p>However, his talk was not continuous as it was frequently interrupted by an involuntary contractions <code> 'puke' and 'hiccup'</code> . Now i am hiring you to clean up his <code>'puke'</code> and <code>'hiccup' </code> and tell me the old man's wisdom words.</p><p>Because drunk man also needs to take a pause and take a deep breath, you have to remove those pauses (redundant/unnecessary spaces).</p>
