Every month I accept applications for schooling from new guys and when I process it manually, I get a little tired. Ð¡ould you help me and automate this process?</p><p>If so, you have information about the ages of all these new pupils (<code>array</code> of ages - only positive digital numbers). Your goal is to sort sort these ages by grade. Your function <code>schoolSelection</code> needs to return an object where <code>key</code> is grade level and <code>value</code> is a number of convenient ages. </p><p>Additional information: </p><pre><code>Level           -&gt; ageKindergarten     -&gt; 51st grade        -&gt; 62nd grade        -&gt; 73rd grade        -&gt; 84th grade        -&gt; 9</code></pre><p>Example:</p><pre><code>schoolSelection([5, 7, 4, 9, 10, 5, 15, 9, 5])Output: {  'Kindergarten': 3,  '1st grade': 0,  '2nd grade': 1,   '3rd grade': 0,   '4th grade': 2,}</code></pre>
