(Well it's interesting to me, so there!)</p><h3 id="polydivisib-huh-what">Polydivisib... huh what?</h3><p>So what are they?</p><p>A polydivisible number is divisible in an unusual way. The first digit is cleanly divisible by <code>1</code>, the first two digits are cleanly divisible by <code>2</code>, the first three by <code>3</code>, and so on.</p><h3 id="examples">Examples</h3><p>Let's take the number <code>1232</code> as an example.</p><pre><code>1     / 1 = 1     // Works12    / 2 = 6     // Works123   / 3 = 41    // Works1232  / 4 = 308   // Works</code></pre><p><code>1232</code> is a polydivisible number.</p><p>However, let's take the number <code>123220</code> and see what happens.</p><pre><code> 1      /1 = 1    // Works 12     /2 = 6    // Works 123    /3 = 41   // Works 1232   /4 = 308  // Works 12322  /5 = 2464.4         // Doesn't work 123220 /6 = 220536.333...  // Doesn't work</code></pre><p><code>123220</code> is not polydivisible.</p><h3 id="your-job-check-if-a-number-is-polydivisible-or-not">Your job: check if a number is polydivisible or not.</h3><p>Return <code>true</code> if it is, and <code>false</code> if it isn't.</p><p>Note: All inputs will be valid numbers between <code>0</code> and <code>2^53-1 (9,007,199,254,740,991)</code> (inclusive).Note: All single digit numbers (including <code>0</code>) are trivially polydivisible.
