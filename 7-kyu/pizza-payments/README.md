Depending on the price of the pizza, they are going to divide the costs:</p><ul><li>If the pizza is less than €5,- Michael invites Kate, so Michael pays the full price.</li><li>Otherwise Kate will contribute 1/3 of the price, but no more than €10 (she's broke :-) and Michael pays the rest.</li></ul><p>How much is Michael going to pay? Calculate the amount with two decimals, if necessary.</p>
