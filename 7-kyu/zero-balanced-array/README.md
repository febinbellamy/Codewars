For example,</p><pre><code>[1, -1, 2, -2] — zero-balanced, sum of elements is 0 + each element has its own negative;[0, 1, -1] — zero-balanced, 0 is the negative of itself (0 == -0);[3] — not zero-balanced; sum != 0;[3, -2, -1] — not zero-balanced, sum == 0, but the array has 3 but not its negative, -3;[1, 1, 1, 1, -1, 3, -3, -3] — despite having sum == 0 and all elements having their negatives, the latters must have the same amount as their originals, which doesn't comply here (four '1' and one '-1'), therefore, this array is not zero-balanced.</code></pre><p>Write a function that returns <code>true</code> if its argument is <em>zero-balanced</em> array, else return <code>false</code>. </p><p><strong>Note</strong>: an empty array will not sum to 0 since there are no elements in it, therefore, it should be treated as not zero-balanced.</p>
