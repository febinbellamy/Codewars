Well, no more! You're going to solve all the quadratic equations you might ever[1] have to wrangle with in the future once and for all by coding up the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_formula" data-turbolinks="false" target="_blank">quadratic formula</a> to handle them automatically.</p><p>Write a function <code>quadratic_formula()</code> that takes three arguments, <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code> that represent the coefficients in a formula of the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0. Your function shoud return a list with two elements where each element is one of the two roots. If the formula produces a double root the result should be a list where both elements are that value.</p><p>For example, <code>quadraticFormula(2, 16, 1)</code> should return the list <code>[-0.06299606299409444, -7.937003937005906]</code>.</p><p>The order of the roots is not important.</p><p>[1] Well, not <em>ever</em> ever. You don't need to worry about getting quadratic equations with complex roots where you need the square root of a negative number. All the test cases will be for equations with real roots.</p>
